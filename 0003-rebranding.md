# Rebranding

Due to a brand conflict with "Prevency," we underwent a rebranding process from "Privency" to "ZKorum."

ZKorum represents:

- ZK for "Zero-Knowledge", which is the essential cryptographic component required to ensure privacy and eligibility.
- Korum for "Quorum," indicating the minimum number of participants necessary for decision-making or consensus.
