🔐 Introducing Personas and In-App Wallet! 🔒

Originally, we planned to integrate an external wallet, but after valuable discussions with Dock and Veramo, we have decided to utilize our app as the wallet for our MVP! 📲💼

One of the key features of ZKorum is the ability for users to distinguish different aspects of their identities. Whether it's professional credentials, sport association affiliations, or public personas, ZKorum aims to provide a secure environment for managing these aspects independently. We call these individual facets "Personas." Each Persona represents a unique account within ZKorum and is associated with specific identifiers (such as email addresses).

ZKorum ensures user privacy by preventing correlation between personas. For example, imagine you have a professional career in a conservative corporation and participate in your company's community on ZKorum using your corporate email address as the associated persona.

Now, let's say you're also an outspoken political activist, writing anonymously on Medium under a unique pen name. To engage in discussions with your political party on ZKorum, you'd use a separate persona associated with the email address used on Medium. By using different identifiers for each persona, ZKorum guarantees that they cannot be linked together, safeguarding your privacy.

Accessing your personas is simple. You'll have a Master Account tied to a Master Password. By remembering this single password, you can securely unlock and manage all your personas.
The list of personas associated to a Master Account is encrypted on our servers, guaranteeing their confidentiality and availability.

Integrating with existing wallets and credentials remains a long-term goal for us, but our in-app wallet will ensure that users can confidently manage their personas and credentials within the app.
